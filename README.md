Beer Drinkin is a .NET beer tracking app for iOS using Xamarin. It's powered by various Microsoft services such as Microsoft's Azure App Services, Cognitive Services, and Azure Search.

BeerDrinkin is a cloud-enabled, C# powered Beer tracking app built using Xamarin and Windows Azure. It is designed to showcase both Xamarin's cross-platform capability and the magic of using Azure to build scalable, feature rich applications. The project is still actively developed with a comprehensive set of features. 

###### Work in progress
  - Traditional style iOS 
  - MVC Website
  - Azure backend (.NET based)
  
###### Todo
  - Xamarin.Forms for Android & Windows Phone
  - Native Mac Client (Xamarin.Mac)
  - Machine Learning
  
### Development
Want to contribute? Great!

BeerDrinkin is developed entirely in C# which makes it extremely easy to get started. I'd love to work with people who are interested in contributing to the project. If you have experience with C# then there's plenty of opportunities to get involved. 

Grab a copy of the project and start tweaking, fixing bugs and adding new features. I'll happily accept pull requests so don't be shy! 

####Design
If you're a Mac user, then please get in touch directly with me to request a copy of the Sketch.app file which contains all the current designs. If you're looking to port Beer Drinkin to Android or UWP then you'll find the following colour palette useful.
