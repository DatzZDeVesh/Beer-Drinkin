Beer Drinkin is a .NET beer tracking app for iOS using Xamarin. It's powered by various Microsoft services such as Microsoft's Azure App Services, Cognitive Services, and Azure Search.

BeerDrinkin is a cloud-enabled, C# powered Beer tracking app built using Xamarin and Windows Azure. It is designed to showcase both Xamarin's cross-platform capability and the magic of using Azure to build scalable, feature rich applications. The project is still actively developed with a comprehensive set of features.
