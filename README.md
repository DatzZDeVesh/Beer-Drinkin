Beer Drinkin is a .NET beer tracking app for iOS using Xamarin. It's powered by various Microsoft services such as Microsoft's Azure App Services, Cognitive Services, and Azure Search.

BeerDrinkin is a cloud-enabled, C# powered Beer tracking app built using Xamarin and Windows Azure. It is designed to showcase both Xamarin's cross-platform capability and the magic of using Azure to build scalable, feature rich applications. The project is still actively developed with a comprehensive set of features. 

###### Work in progress

### Development
Want to contribute? Great!

BeerDrinkin is developed entirely in C# which makes it extremely easy to get started. I'd love to work with people who are interested in contributing to the project. If you have experience with C# then there's plenty of opportunities to get involved. 

Grab a copy of the project and start tweaking, fixing bugs and adding new features. I'll happily accept pull requests so don't be shy! 

### Todos

 - Write Unit and UI Tests
 - Bug fixing
 - Completing iOS app
 - Forms version of app (for the first release)
